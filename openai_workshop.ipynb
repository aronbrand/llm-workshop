As enterprises move to adopt cloud, they need the right balance of choice of file services and a level of security and control that is superior to traditional ways of operating.

Legacy point solutions generate data silos, do not provide a holistic view of data governance and security, and inflate IT management overhead and costs. To address this void, CTERA built a unified solution that combines the benefits of local file services at the edge with cloud storage.\n",

      "                      The “C” in CTERA stands for cloud – in 2008 the level of enterprise adoption of cloud was very low as we continued to build out and mature our platform. But today an entirely different picture has emerged. In fact, by 2024, large enterprises will triple their unstructured data stored as file or object storage on-premises, at the edge or in the public cloud, compared to 20201. As enterprises move to adopt cloud, they need the right balance of choice of file services and a level of security and control that is superior to traditional ways of operating. A rapid transformation to ‘IT-as-a-Service’ is changing strategies across the enterprise as file service platform requirements become the same that have existed for some time in the service provider market – these IT strategies are taking shape in worldwide adoption of the CTERA Enterprise File Services Platform.\n",

       "  Document(page_content='The “C” in CTERA stands for cloud – in 2008 the level of enterprise adoption of cloud was very low as we continued to build out and mature our platform. But today an entirely different picture has emerged. In fact, by 2024, large enterprises will triple their unstructured data stored as file or object storage on-premises, at the edge or in the public cloud, compared to 20201. As enterprises move to adopt cloud, they need the right balance of choice of file services and a level of security and control that is superior to traditional ways of operating.
