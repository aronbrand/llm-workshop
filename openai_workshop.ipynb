       " Document(page_content=\"Company\\n\\nOptimizing Enterprise File Services\\n\\nCTERA’s mission is to enable cloud-driven enterprise IT organizations to deliver secure file services. We believe modern organizations should be able to harness the agility, scalability, collaboration and cost efficiencies of the cloud, without compromising the performance, availability or security of their data.\\n\\nAbout Us\\n\\nWe Live in the Cloud... and Breathe Security\\n\\nCTERA Networks was founded in 2008 by IT security veterans, who anticipated the digital transformation that cloud computing would bring to enterprise IT, as well as the challenges it presented for infrastructure management, data governance, privacy and security.\\n\\nIn a world where data flows between clouds, offices and endpoints – CTERA has focused on building a secure enterprise file services platform that centrally manages the file storage, control and governance needs of the modern enterprise.\\n\\nGlobal File System Whitepaper\\n\\nDCIG Compares CTERA and NetApp\\n\\nOur Approach\\n\\nUnified Multi-Cloud Data Management\\n\\nfrom Edge to Cloud\\n\\nFrom the outset, CTERA realized that traditional file storage and collaboration solutions are not suitable for the modern enterprise workplace. Legacy point solutions generate data silos, do not provide a holistic view of data governance and security, and inflate IT management overhead and costs. To address this void, CTERA built a unified solution that combines the benefits of local file services at the edge with cloud storage.\\n\\nThe CTERA Enterprise File Services Platform unifies endpoint, branch office and cloud file services to enable next-generation file storage, collaboration, data protection, and disaster recovery.\\n\\nPowered by a cloud-native global file system, CTERA’s platform enables multi-cloud data management with full control over data residency, military-grade security and edge-to-cloud acceleration for desktops and branch offices.\\n\\nCTERA helped pioneer enterprise file services delivery in the cloud era by building secure and efficient protocols for edge-to-cloud data transport, RESTful APIs that drive operational efficiencies, and a multi-tenant data management model to ensure data isolation and confidentiality.\\n\\nThe Time is Now\\n\\nThe “C” in CTERA stands for cloud – in 2008 the level of enterprise adoption of cloud was very low as we continued to build out and mature our platform. But today an entirely different picture has emerged. In fact, by 2024, large enterprises will triple their unstructured data stored as file or object storage on-premises, at the edge or in the public cloud, compared to 20201. As enterprises move to adopt cloud, they need the right balance of choice of file services and a level of security and control that is superior to traditional ways of operating. A rapid transformation to ‘IT-as-a-Service’ is changing strategies across the enterprise as file service platform requirements become the same that have existed for some time in the service provider market – these IT strategies are taking shape in worldwide adoption of the CTERA Enterprise File Services Platform.\\n\\nGartner Market Guide for Hybrid Cloud Storage March 2020\\n\\nOur Customers\\n\\nThe Trusted Choice of Leading Enterprises\\n\\nWith over 50,000 connected sites and millions of corporate users, CTERA powers the file services transformations of leading global banks, insurance companies, telecommunications firms, and federal and defense organizations.\\n\\nSee All Customers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCTERA at a Glance\\n\\n‘08\\n\\nFounded in 2008 by Liran Eshel & Zohar Kaufman\\n\\n50k\\n\\nAdopted by 50,000 Businesses Worldwide\\n\\n110\\n\\nDeployed in Over 110 Countries Worldwide\\n\\nOur Investors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLocated Worldwide\\n\\nNorth America\\n\\nEurope\\n\\nAsia\\n\\nAustralia\\n\\nRecognized as an Industry Leader\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Latest Buzz\\n\\nKeep up with the latest news, posts, events, webinars and more\\n\\nNews\\n\\nNews\\n\\nStockage : Ctera verrouille en écriture les données… de production\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\nAll News\\n\\nEvents\\n\\nEvents\\n\\nElite CIO/CISO Atlanta\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\nWebinars\\n\\nWebinars\\n\\nTop 5 Insights on File Storage Evolution with CTERA and GigaOm\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nNavigating the Edge: Our Webinar with Hitachi Vantara\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\nView Blog\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nJoin our rapidly growing, challenging and innovative workplace, peppered with a fun and casual vibe.\\n\\nVisit CTERA Careers\\n\\nOur Team\\n\\nWe're managed by a seasoned results-driven team with proven success in leading high-growth technology startups.\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\nPrevious                        \\n                        Contact\\n                                                                        \\n\\t                        Let us know how we can help you.

       "\n",
       "CTERA Networks, founded in 2008 by IT security veterans Liran Eshel and Zohar Kaufman, offers secure enterprise file services through their platform, connecting remote sites and users to the cloud without compromising security or performance. Their feature-rich platform allows for unified access across various devices and locations, supporting multi-cloud environments for optimal security, compliance, and economics. CTERA's Enterprise File Services Platform unifies endpoint, branch office, and cloud file services, enabling next-generation file storage, collaboration, data protection, and disaster recovery. Their mission is to enable cloud-driven enterprise IT organizations to deliver secure file services while maintaining data performance, availability, and security. CTERA has focused on building a secure enterprise file services platform that centrally manages the file storage, control, and governance needs of the modern enterprise, with a unified multi-cloud data management approach from Edge to Cloud. They have pioneered secure and efficient protocols for edge-to-cloud data transport, RESTful APIs for operational efficiencies, and a multi-tenant data management model for data isolation and confidentiality. The “C” in CTERA stands for cloud – in 2008 the level of enterprise adoption of cloud was very low as we continued to build out and mature our platform. But today an entirely different picture has emerged. In fact, by 2024, large enterprises will triple their unstructured data stored as file or object storage on-premises, at the edge or in the public cloud, compared to 20201. As enterprises move to adopt cloud, they need the right balance of choice of file services and a level of security and control that is superior to traditional ways of operating. A rapid transformation to ‘IT-as-a-Service’ is changing strategies across the enterprise as file service platform requirements become the same that have existed for some time in the service provider market – these IT strategies are taking shape in worldwide adoption of the CTERA Enterprise File Services Platform.
