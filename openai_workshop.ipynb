Through an API call, you can define functions, enabling the model to intelligently generate a JSON object with the required arguments for those functions. Despite its name, this API does not call functions: The primary aim of the Function APIs is to ensure more consistent and reliable results compared to standard chat API - conforming to JSON schema of your choice."
